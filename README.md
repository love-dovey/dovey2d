# dövey2d
dövey2d (all lowercase) is a very tiny extension for LÖVE2D that makes it slightly easier to work with.

I made this for my own personal projects.

### external libraries used

- [rxi/json.lua](https://github.com/rxi/json.lua)

### recommended usage
just create a submodule for the engine in your LÖVE2D project with the following commands
```sh
git submodule init
git submodule add https://github.com/love-dovey/dovey2d.git dovey
```
though if you prefer using SSH verification, change the link in the last command to `git@github.com:pisayesiwsi/dovey2d.git`

if these instructions aren't enough, here's an example game you could use as a reference point
